    "Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.[6] Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.[7][8][9] He is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.[10]\n",

    "Born in Maida Vale, London, Turing was raised in southern England. He graduated at King's College, Cambridge, with a degree in mathematics.

In 1938, he obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University. During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Axis powers in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic.[11][12]\n",

    "After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory, at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers[13] and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis[1] and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s.

       "[' alan mathison turing obe frs    tj  r        june          june       was an english mathematician  computer scientist  logician  cryptanalyst  philosopher  and theoretical biologist ',\n",
       " '    turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science  providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the turing machine  which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer ',\n",
       " '          he is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence ',\n",
       " '      born in maida vale  london  turing was raised in southern england ',\n",
       " 'he graduated at king s college  cambridge  with a degree in mathematics ',\n",
       " 'whilst he was a fellow at cambridge  he published a proof demonstrating that some purely mathematical yes no questions can never be answered by computation and defined a turing machine  and went on to prove the halting problem for turing machines is undecidable ',\n",
       " 'in       he obtained his phd from the department of mathematics at princeton university ',\n",
       " 'during the second world war  turing worked for the government code and cypher school  gc cs  at bletchley park  britain s codebreaking centre that produced ultra intelligence ',\n",
       " 'for a time he led hut    the section that was responsible for german naval cryptanalysis ',\n",
       " 'here  he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of german ciphers  including improvements to the pre war polish bombe method  an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the enigma machine ',\n",
       " 'turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the allies to defeat the axis powers in many crucial engagements  including the battle of the atlantic ',\n",
       " '          after the war  turing worked at the national physical laboratory  where he designed the automatic computing engine  ace   one of the first designs for a stored program computer ',\n",
       " 'in       turing joined max newman s computing machine laboratory  at the victoria university of manchester  where he helped develop the manchester computers     and became interested in mathematical biology ',\n",
       " 'he wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis    and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the belousov zhabotinsky reaction  first observed in the     s ',\n",
       " 'despite these accomplishments  turing was never fully recognised in britain during his lifetime because much of his work was covered by the official secrets act ',\n",
       " '      turing was prosecuted in      for homosexual acts ',\n",
       " 'he accepted hormone treatment with des  a procedure commonly referred to as chemical castration  as an alternative to prison ',\n",
       " 'turing died on   june          days before his   nd birthday  from cyanide poisoning ',\n",
       " 'an inquest determined his death as a suicide  but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning ',\n",
       " 'following a public campaign in       the british prime minister gordon brown made an official public apology on behalf of the british government for  the appalling way  turing  was treated  ',\n",
       " 'queen elizabeth ii granted a posthumous pardon in      ',\n",
       " 'the term  alan turing law  is now used informally to refer to a      law in the united kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts ',\n",
       " '      turing has an extensive legacy with statues of him and many things named after him  including an annual award for computer science innovations ',\n",
       " 'he appears on the current bank of england     note  which was released on    june       to coincide with his birthday ',\n",
       " 'a      bbc series  as voted by the audience  named him the greatest person of the   th century ']"
